# Digital-image-processing-Project
: Road extraction plays one of the major roles in many applications regarding the betterment of present human lives. Roads are very essential features for transportation and city palnning. Road detection from satellite images has now become an important topic in photogrammetry after remote sensing technology development. Thus, the need for road extraction using a robust and efficient method is also high. So, In our project we are extracting the roads from high resolution images using morphological tools
